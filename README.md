This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# OXO
Project demonstrates how to use React Javascript library for building user interfaces. OXO is a classic tic-tac-toe game against the computer. Game intelligence is based on a heuristic algorithm consisting of five different game strategies described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). Game starts with naive (random) strategy. More advanced strategies are applied when opponent (user) wins games. The most advanced strategy yields almost perfect game. Algorithm also adapts (downshifts) to situation where oppoenent has lost several games.

Playable game is deployed [here](http://mtakanen.github.io/).
